### Client-server interaction

This project implements a server-client architecture for exchanging data between programs using sockets. Specifically, the server program contains data about students of a group, including their name, surname, age, and average score. The client program is able to perform specific requests to the server program, such as retrieving a complete list of students, a list of students older than 18 years, and a list of students receiving a scholarship (average score above 4).
